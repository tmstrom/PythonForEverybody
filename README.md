 - **When Python is running in the interactive mode and displaying the Chevron prompt (>>>) it is asking:** *"What would you like it to do?"*
 
 - **Python scripts (files) have names that end with:** *"py".*
 
 - *"For"* **is a reserved word in Python.**
 
 - **A USB memory stick is an example of a secondary memory component of computer architecture.**
 
 - **A** *"Syntax-Error"* **means that the computer did not understand the code you submitted.**
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 **Chapter 2: Variables and Expressions**
------------------------------------

 - **An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand side and a variable to store the result**

 - **We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement ( = )**

 - **It is possible for both sides of an equation to have the same variable, if that variable had already been assigned a previous value. The first value is then plugged into the expression, evaluated, and the new value overrides the old value**

 - **When we string operators together, Python needs to know which one to do first**

  - **This is called "Operator Precedence"**

 - **Which operator takes precedence over the others?**

 - **Ask Python what type something is by using the type() function**

 - **Variables with numbers are called integers**

 - **Variables with decimals are called floating points**

 - **When you put an integer and floating point into an expression, the integer is implicitly converted into a float**

 - **You can control this with built in functions int() and float()**

 - **Integer division produces a floating point result**

 - **You can also use int() and float() to convert between string and integers**

 - **You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters**

 - **Python can be instructed to pause and read data from the user using input function (input())**

 - **The input() function returns a string**

 - **Anything after a # is ignored**

 - **Use # to leave notes to remind you of what you were doing in a program**

## **Chapter 3: Conditional Code** ##

 - **Boolean expressions ask a question and produce a Yes or No result which we use to control program flow**

 - **Boolean expressions using comparison operators evaluate to True/ False or Yes/ No**

 - **Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables**

 - **Indentation is very important in Python**

 - **Surround a dangerous section of code with try and except**

 - **If the code in the try works, the except is skipped**

 - **If the code in the try fails, it jumps to the except**
 
 ## **Chapter 4: Functions** ##

 - **def stands for "start the definition of a function**
 
 - **A function is some stored code that we use. A function takes some input and produces an output**

 - **When you put an integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float**

 - **You can control this with the built in functions int() and float()**

 - **You can also use int() and float() to convert between string and integers**

 - **You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters**

 - **We create a new function using the def keyword followed by optional parameters in parentheses**

 - **We indent the body of the function**

 - **This defines the function but does not execute the body of the functions**

 - **An argument is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function**

 - **We use arguments so we can direct the function to do different kinds of work when we call it at different times**

 - **We put the arguments in parentheses after the name of the function**

 - **A parameter is a variable which we use in the function definition. It is a "handle" that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a particular function invocation**
 
 
 
## **Chapter 5: Loops and Iteration**
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/neFjDMx02nSLsSswzEjevGcYkecJuapJg7UGxnGD_f5jjuDSUND_wktFAr1kUMIILEi1Ag9DGbQ)

 - **Loops (repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time though a loop. Often these iteration variables go through a sequence of numbers.**

 - **The "break" statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop.**
 
 - **It is like a loop test that can happen anywhere in the body of the loop.**
 
 - **The continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration.**
 
 - **Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that can change each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through the sequence or set.**
 
 - **The iteration variable "iterates" through the sequence (ordered set).**
 
 - **The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence.**
 
 - **The iteration variable moves through all of the values in a sequence.**
 
 - **The trick to making a smart loop is "knowing" something about the whole loop when you are stuck writing code that sees only one entry at a time.**
 
 - **To count how many times we execute a loop, we introduce a counter variable that starts at 0 and we add one to it each time through the loop.**
 - **An average just combines the counting and sum patterns and divides when the loop is done.**

 ## Chapter 6: Strings

 ![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j2bdCeWr_lHVg3R2Rtm5PolVJY95PTloSOoXu_wqdPMmJwJxXkhZozfsEkAaifdlQPdV0Y_c2lbb)
 

 - **A string is a sequence of numbers**
 - **A string literal uses quotes 'Hello' or "Hello"**
 - **For strings, + means "concatenate"**
 - **When a string contains numbers, it is still a string**
 - **We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int().**
 - **We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets**
 - **The index value must be an integer and starts at zero**
 - **The index value can be an expression that is computed**
 - **We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets**
 - **The index value must be an integer and starts at zero**
 - **The index value can be an expression that is computed**
 - **The built-in function len gives us the length of a string**
 - **A function is some stored code that we can use. A function takes some input and produces an output**
 - **Using a while statement and an iteration variable, and the len function, we can construct a loop to loop at each of the letters in a string individually**
 - **When the + operator is applied to strings, it means "concatenation"**
 - **The in keyword can also be used to check to see if one string is "in" another string**
 - **The in expression is a logical expression that returns True or False and can be used in an if statement**
 
 ## **Chapter 7: Files**

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2FOoaPGH997KG3XpizCB5es6abhpWuuiVChPUlgZuytTbFvjP34c7hBtqilH1mVSRgbDkZK0v6at)

 - **A text file can be thought of as a sequence of lines**
 - **Before we can read the contents of a file, we must tell python which file we are going to work with and what we will be doing with the file**
 - **This is done with the () function**
 - **open () returns a "file handle" - a variable used to perform operations on a file**
 - **Similar to "File->Open" in a Word Processor**
 - **We use a special character called the "newline" to indicate when a line ends**
 - **We represent it a \n in strings**
 - **Newline is still one character - not two**
 - **A text file has newlines at the end of each line**
 - **A file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line is a string in the sequence**
 - **We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence**
 - **Remember - a sequence is an ordered set**
 - **We can strip the whitespace from the right-hand side of the string using rstrip() from the string library**
 - **The newline is considered 'whitespace' and is stripped**
 
 # **Chapter 8: Lists**

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_WcOZD2fIOxNuvZz8QLnlsAhqmikMRtGGtRkwDbqYvISrOI7gE_vUVywFINOThUm4YSDWNgdem5v)

 - **Most of our variables have one value in them when we put a new value in the variable, the old value is overwritten**
 - **A collection allows us to put many values in a single "variable"**
 - **A collection is nice because we can carry many values around in one convenient package**
 - **List constraints are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas**
 - **A list element can be any Python object - even another list**
 - **A list can be empty**
 - **Strings are "immutable" - we cannot change the contents of a string - we must make a new string to make any change**
 - **We cannot create an empty list and then add elements using the append method**
 - **The list stays in order and new elements are added at the end of the list**
 - **A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do something to change the order**
 - **A list can be sorted**
 
 ## **Chapter 9: Dictionaries**

![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/v4GEG9sseQt466YAPzkkB4svoGGrI7zxDc3LwY243_k3iiWPeH9eUMvb2HZ6BQStdtYAO-O9MqZ1)

 - **A list is a linear collection of values that stay in order whereas a dictionary is a "bag" of values, each with its own label**
 - **Dictionaries are Python's most powerful data collection**
 - **Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like operations in Python**
 - **They have different names in different languages**
 - **Lists index their entries based on the position in the list**
 - **Dictionaries are like bags - no order**
 - **Dictionaries are like lists except that they use keys instead of numbers to look up values**
 - **We index the things we put in the dictionary with a "lookup tag"**
 - **Dictionary literals use curly braces and have a list of key: value pairs**
 - **You can make an empty dictionary using curly braces**
 - **One common use of dictionaries is counting how often we "see" something**
 - **The general pattern to count the words in a line of text is to split the line into words, then loop through the words and use a dictionary to track the count of each word independently**
 - **You can get a list of keys, values, or both from a dictionary**
 
 ## **Chapter 10: Tuples**
![enter image description here](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lv2LhdGjl-RglSWNcxH3UBPkRzIUtCSJjwhnleCB0_ilG2fOEz4E8drchS2dbYTSghM0qY7UoxS6)

 - **Tuples are another kind of sequence that functions much like a list - they have elements which are indexed starting at zero**
 - **Since Python does not have to build tuple structures to be modifiable, they are simpler and more efficient in terms of memory use and performance than lists**
 - **So in our program when we are making "temporary variables" we prefer tuples over lists**
 - **We can also put a tuple on the left-hand side of an assignment statement**
 - **We can even omit the parenthesis**
 - **The items () method in dictionaries returns a list of (key value) tuples**
 - **The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. If the first item is equal, Python goes on to the next element, and so on until it finds the elements that differ**
 - **We can do this even more directly using the built-in function sorted that takes a sequence as a parameter and returns a sorted sequence**
 - **If we could construct a list of tuples of the form (value, key) we could sort by value**
 - **We do this with a for loop that creates a list of tuples**
 - **List comprehension creates a dynamic list. In this case, we make a list of reversed tuples and then sort it**
