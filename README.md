 - **When Python is running in the interactive mode and displaying the Chevron prompt (>>>) it is asking:** *"What would you like it to do?"*
 
 - **Python scripts (files) have names that end with:** *"py".*
 
 - *"For"* **is a reserved word in Python.**
 
 - **A USB memory stick is an example of a secondary memory component of computer architecture.**
 
 - **A** *"Syntax-Error"* **means that the computer did not understand the code you submitted.**
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 **Chapter 2: Variables and Expressions**
------------------------------------

 - **An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand side and a variable to store the result**

 - **We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement ( = )**

 - **It is possible for both sides of an equation to have the same variable, if that variable had already been assigned a previous value. The first value is then plugged into the expression, evaluated, and the new value overrides the old value**

 - **When we string operators together, Python needs to know which one to do first**

  - **This is called "Operator Precedence"**

 - **Which operator takes precedence over the others?**

 - **Ask Python what type something is by using the type() function**

 - **Variables with numbers are called integers**

 - **Variables with decimals are called floating points**

 - **When you put an integer and floating point into an expression, the integer is implicitly converted into a float**

 - **You can control this with built in functions int() and float()**

 - **Integer division produces a floating point result**

 - **You can also use int() and float() to convert between string and integers**

 - **You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters**

 - **Python can be instructed to pause and read data from the user using input function (input())**

 - **The input() function returns a string**

 - **Anything after a # is ignored**

 - **Use # to leave notes to remind you of what you were doing in a program**

## **Chapter 3: Conditional Code** ##

 - **Boolean expressions ask a question and produce a Yes or No result which we use to control program flow**

 - **Boolean expressions using comparison operators evaluate to True/ False or Yes/ No**

 - **Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables**

 - **Indentation is very important in Python**

 - **Surround a dangerous section of code with try and except**

 - **If the code in the try works, the except is skipped**

 - **If the code in the try fails, it jumps to the except**
 
 ## **Chapter 4: Functions** ##

 - **def stands for "start the definition of a function**
 
 - **A function is some stored code that we use. A function takes some input and produces an output**

 - **When you put an integer and floating point in an expression, the integer is implicitly converted to a float**

 - **You can control this with the built in functions int() and float()**

 - **You can also use int() and float() to convert between string and integers**

 - **You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters**

 - **We create a new function using the def keyword followed by optional parameters in parentheses**

 - **We indent the body of the function**

 - **This defines the function but does not execute the body of the functions**

 - **An argument is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function**

 - **We use arguments so we can direct the function to do different kinds of work when we call it at different times**

 - **We put the arguments in parentheses after the name of the function**

 - **A parameter is a variable which we use in the function definition. It is a "handle" that allows the code in the function to access the arguments for a particular function invocation**
 
 
 
## **Chapter 5: Loops and Iteration**

 - **Loops (repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time though a loop. Often these iteration variables go through a sequence of numbers.**

 - **The "break" statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop.**
 
 - **It is like a loop test that can happen anywhere in the body of the loop.**
 
 - **The continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration.**
 
 - **Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that can change each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through the sequence or set.**
 
 - **The iteration variable "iterates" through the sequence (ordered set).**
 
 - **The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence.**
 
 - **The iteration variable moves through all of the values in a sequence.**
 
 - **The trick to making a smart loop is "knowing" something about the whole loop when you are stuck writing code that sees only one entry at a time.**
 
 - **To count how many times we execute a loop, we introduce a counter variable that starts at 0 and we add one to it each time through the loop.**
 - **An average just combines the counting and sum patterns and divides when the loop is done.**

 ## Chapter 6: Strings

 - **A string is a sequence of numbers**
 - **A string literal uses quotes 'Hello' or "Hello"**
 - **For strings, + means "concatenate"**
 - **When a string contains numbers, it is still a string**
 - **We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int().**
 - **We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets**
 - **The index value must be an integer and starts at zero**
 - **The index value can be an expression that is computed**
 - **We can get at any single character in a string using an index specified in square brackets**
 - **The index value must be an integer and starts at zero**
 - **The index value can be an expression that is computed**
 - **The built-in function len gives us the length of a string**
 - **A function is some stored code that we can use. A function takes some input and produces an output**
 - **Using a while statement and an iteration variable, and the len function, we can construct a loop to loop at each of the letters in a string individually**
 - **When the + operator is applied to strings, it means "concatenation"**
 - **The in keyword can also be used to check to see if one string is "in" another string**
 - **The in expression is a logical expression that returns True or False and can be used in an if statement**
