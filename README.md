***Python For Everybody***
--------------------


**Goals**

    

 - Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

**Boundaries / Scope**

    

 - Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with
   Python) 
       
 - Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

**Success criteria**

    

 - My own application for data retrieval and processing.

   

 - Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate
   activity.

**Constraints**

    

 - I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and
   view the course content but not submit projects or earn the
   certification.

**Assumptions**

    

 - The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.

    

 - I have all required software.

  

 - I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

**Stakeholders**

    

 - Professor - for grade

    

 - Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make
   them proud

   

 - Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student
   portfolio which could help with getting a job

 - **When Python is running in the interactive mode and displaying the Chevron prompt (>>>) it is asking:** *"What would you like it to do?"*
 
 - **Python scripts (files) have names that end with:** *"py".*
 
 - *"For"* **is a reserved word in Python.**
 
 - **A USB memory stick is an example of a secondary memory component of computer architecture.**
 
 - **A** *"Syntax-Error"* **means that the computer did not understand the code you submitted.**
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 **Chapter 2: Variables and Expressions**

 - **An assignment statement consists of an expression on the right hand side and a variable to store the result**

 - **We assign a value to a variable using the assignment statement ( = )**

 - **It is possible for both sides of an equation to have the same variable, if that variable had already been assigned a previous value. The first value is then plugged into the expression, evaluated, and the new value overrides the old value**

 - **When we string operators together, Python needs to know which one to do first**

 - **This is called **"*operator precedence*"

 - **Which operator takes precedence over the others?**

 - **Ask Python what type something is by using the type() function**

 - **Variables with numbers are called integers**

 - **Variables with decimals are called floating points**

 - **When you put an integer and floating point into an expression, the integer is implicitly converted into a float**

 - **You can control this with built in functions int() and float()**

 - **Integer division produces a floating point result**

 - **You can also use int() and float() to convert between string and integers**

 - **You will get an error if the string does not contain numeric characters**

 - **Python can be instructed to pause and read data from the user using input function (input())**

 - **The input() function returns a string**

 - **Anything after a # is ignored**

 - **Use # to leave notes to remind you of what you were doing in a program**
